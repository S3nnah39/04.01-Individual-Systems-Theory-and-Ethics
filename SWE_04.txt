CASE: A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit

Ethical Quandry       |   Self interest  |  Client interest | Other interest  |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customer consent      |		X		  X		   X
Quantity of Data      |                           X		   X
Level of disclosure   |			          X                X




The motive behind an ethical dilemma dictates the purpose the action to some extent. It can be to 
the interest of the self, the client, or other's. If the customer gives consent for their data, the 
scenario given may interest all parties if the data is to improve the service provided. 
However, if the customer does not consent, it only benefits the retailer and the other, because it may 
used in ways that determine personal attributes about a consumer.

A retailer selling your personal information to others for profit is unethical. The immorality of the 
action can be called into question, if the customer consented to it by signing the terms and conditions. 
However, the product being personal information, violates an individual's rights. Depending on the quantity 
of data being sold, the level of disclosure of uniquely identifying information as well as the type of data. 
On the other hand, the purpose of the action can be to gain a better understanding of their customers, provide 
current  and  potential  customers  with  personalized  products,  services,  and recommendations, and predict 
changes and shift in demand.
